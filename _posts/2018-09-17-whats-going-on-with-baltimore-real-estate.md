It’s been a while since I’ve brought you a market report, and I think it’s important to keep you all informed about what is happening in the real estate market today.

In Baltimore, there is a lot of fear that the market is crashing. Values of homes are going down, which worries builders in the area.

However, the one thing about real estate that is constant is that it isn’t constant—it’s always changing. To be successful, you need to learn how to ride the wave. 

**So if you don’t have any plans to be an investor but you do want to be a homeowner, what do you need to do?**

Those of you who are motivated to take action, send me a message and we can talk to my preferred lender to find out how much you can be pre-approved for. Then we can go house hunting. The benefit to searching for homes right now is that you can still lock in a moderate interest rate; **projections say that rates will be even higher than the current 4.5% by next summer.** By capitalizing off the interest rates and market offers now, you’ll save money on your overall loan, meaning you’ll be able to pay off that principle much sooner than if you purchase after rates have gone up.

For sellers, **you need to know how much equity you have in your house.** If you give me a call, we can schedule a time to do a free market analysis so I can tell you how much your home is worth and what the homes in your neighborhood have sold for; we’ll compare that to what you owe the bank to see how much money you’ll make if you sell your home now.

**When the market goes down, sellers will lose equity as home prices decrease,** which is why it’s in your best interest to find out how much equity you have in your home and whether or not it makes sense for your you to sell it now or to hold it for a little longer.

If you’re not planning to sell your house right now, **I can still give you an estimate of how long you’ll have to stay in that house—when the market shifts, you won’t be able to sell your house as easily.**

If you have any questions about buying or selling real estate, reach out to me. The first step is making something happen.
