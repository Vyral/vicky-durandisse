The very first step to becoming a homeowner is **wanting to become a homeowner.** The moment you decide that you are sick and tired of making someone else rich by paying their mortgage with your rent money—that is when you know you’ve reached the first step.

The next step, after desire, is **taking action. Call a lender!** You can’t purchase a home without finances, after all. Your lender will take you through the pre-qualification process, during which they’ll ask you for basic information regarding your employment, your current rent, and your credit. Don’t worry about them running a credit check for your mortgage application; this is a different kind of report than you’d get from FreeCreditReport.com or Credit Karma. Pulling this credit report will help your lenders understand your financial situation, which will, in turn, allow you to know what you can afford when it comes time to buy a home.

If you have an average credit score of 620 or higher, you’re in luck! That’s the score most lenders are looking for. For any score below that mark, a good lender will show you the steps you need to take to improve your credit. Ask for a credit analyzer; if the lender doesn’t have a credit analyzing tool, they’re not the lender for you. A great lender will be able to help you calculate your debt-to-income ratio and determine how much you qualify for.

Once you finish this pre-approval process, **then you can call your local Realtor** (that means me!) and we can sit down and have a conversation about what steps you need to take next in order to make your dream of owning a home come true. Usually, that’s going out and looking for a house you love and can afford.
