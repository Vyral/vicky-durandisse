It’s time for a fourth quarter real estate market update as we head closer to the end of 2018. Here’s what we’re seeing out in the Golston market right now. Contrary to popular belief, it’s a great time to sell. Most home sellers think that this is a bad time of year to list for many reasons, including holidays, the weather, and more. **There are plenty of excuses out there for home sellers to use, but here is the truth.**

This is the best time of year for you to sell your home. You’ll have less competition, for starters. **Additionally, this is the time of year where military buyers are coming to the market in anticipation of their relocation.** It’s also the second-biggest time of year for families with children to move as well.&nbsp;

Everyone on the block will put their home on the market come spring and summer, but if you’re on the market now, you can take advantage of the current conditions and sell quickly for a great price.

**As far as homebuyers are concerned, this is also a good time for them to get involved in the market.** Many home sellers are under the impression that nobody is going to look at their home during this time of year. These sellers are highly motivated during this time of year and will be easier to negotiate with than they will be in spring and summer when there is a plethora of buyers and multiple-offer situations. Interest rates have gone up a bit in the past year, but they haven’t risen too far. Homes are still affordable, and this is a perfect time to buy.&nbsp;

**Economic reports are indicating that rates will continue to go up, meaning that buyer pools will shrink and homes will become more expensive.** Getting into the market now will result in the perfect time for you to get into the real estate market whether you’re a buyer or seller.

If you have any questions about buying a home, selling a home, or the real estate market in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
