As a seller, who actually determines the price of your home? How can you know how much your home will sell for? The answer depends on a couple of different factors.

First, you’ll meet with an agent such as myself so we can provide you with a market analysis. In this market analysis, we take three or four homes that are comparable to yours in terms of size, location, and other factors, and see what they’ve sold for.

When pricing your home, you don’t want to think about what one of your neighbors listed their home at—that number doesn’t matter. The true market value of your home is dependent on the price that it sells for. That’s why, when picking comparable homes, we look for homes that are either under contract or have already sold.

In essence, **your home’s market value is whatever the consumer is willing to pay for it.** Every area is different, which is why it’s important to meet with an agent when calculating your home’s market value.&nbsp;

A lot of people assume that adding $20,000 worth of upgrades or renovations into their house means they can automatically add that $20,000 sum to their list price, but that’s not the case. The market analysis process is basically the same process an appraiser takes when valuing your home, except they’re a bit stricter, so don’t think that making upgrades to your home will raise its value. There are, however, certain upgrades you can make that will be more appealing to buyers, and that’s where the value of making upgrades lies.&nbsp;

So, to answer this question, **the market determines the price of your home and what it will sell for.&nbsp;**
