If you’ve listed your home but haven’t received any offers, what should you do? First of all, you need to realize that **there are four primary factors that cause listings to sell: **

1. Price
2. Condition
3. Location
4. Representation

If your home has been sitting on the market without any success, chances are that the problem lies in one of these areas. To avoid such problems, there are a few steps I take with each and every seller I work with.

For one thing, I give sellers who believe their home is worth more than its market value two weeks or 10 showings to try to gain that price. If no offers come in within that time, then it’s time to make a price adjustment. We are living in a society fueled by instantly accessible information. As such, overpriced homes will have a very hard time performing on the market. In fact, **overpricing is the most common reason a listing will sit without offers for an extended period of time. **

In a stable, balanced market, buyers have no reason to put in offers on a home that’s listed far above its market value. 

Truthfully, listing between $2,000 and $5,000 below market value can be a great strategy. This will put sellers in a position to receive multiple offers, while leaving room for negotiation as well. 

But **if offers don’t start coming in after a price adjustment, then it’s time to shift your focus to the home’s condition.** If the roof is in poor condition, the interior of your home smells strongly of cigarette smoke, or there’s so much stuff in the home that buyers have a hard time walking from room to room, then this could very well be the root of your problem. 

Unless you’re in an extremely hot seller’s market, your home will need to be priced correctly, in great condition, in a good location, and represented by a strong agent. Unfortunately, these last two factors aren’t necessarily within your control. You can’t change your house, and, though you could fire your Realtor, they probably aren’t the problem behind your lack of offers. 

Of course, **if you want to make sure your home performs to its full potential, I would be happy to guide you through your listing experience.**
